# AWS Data Exchange: Data Requests

## Introduction

AWS Data Exchange makes it easy for customers to find, subscribe to, and use the third-party data they need in the cloud. We created this repository for customers so that they can let us know what data, and which providers, are most important to them. Based on what you tell us, we will prioritize the selection we look to add to the [catalog](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/search/results?ref_=adx_hp_hr_brw&category=d5a43d97-558f-4be7-8543-cce265fe6d9d&FULFILLMENT_OPTION_TYPE=DATA_EXCHANGE&filters=FULFILLMENT_OPTION_TYPE).

See all requests [here](https://github.com/aws/aws-dataexchange-data-requests/issues), and submit a new request using [this form](https://github.com/aws/aws-dataexchange-data-requests/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=data-request.yml).

## FAQs

**Q: Why did you build this?**

A: We want to provide a forum where AWS Data Exchange users are able to voice their interest in data sets to add to the [AWS Data Exchange Catalog]((https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/search/results?ref_=adx_hp_hr_brw&category=d5a43d97-558f-4be7-8543-cce265fe6d9d&FULFILLMENT_OPTION_TYPE=DATA_EXCHANGE&filters=FULFILLMENT_OPTION_TYPE)). Having participation from the data and developer community helps us prioritize requests, and to demonstrate demand to providers.

**Q: Why are there no dates for when data will be available?**

A: We rely on third-party data providers to on-board their data to AWS Data Exchange. The AWS Data Exchange team will make best efforts to coordinate and facilitate the delivery of requested data. The decision to fulfill the request, however, ultimately sits with the providers, and we cannot provide specific dates for when that will occur.

**Q: Are there any restrictions on what data can be made available on AWS Data Exchange?**

A: Yes. [Publishing guidelines](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/data-exchange/latest/userguide/publishing-guidelines.html) for listing products on AWS Data Exchange and [Terms and Conditions](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/management/terms) for AWS Marketplace Providers restrict certain categories of data.

**Q: What do the categories mean?**

A:
 * **Acknowledged**: We’ve seen it, and it is a candidate for prioritization
 * **Researching**: We’re looking into what fulfillment looks like
 * **Released**: The request has been fulfilled and the data set is available in the AWS Data Exchange Catalog

**Q: Can I “+1” existing requests?**

A: We strongly encourage you to do so as it helps us understand which requests will have the widest impact. You can navigate to the request and add a reaction (thumbs up). We also encourage you to subscribe to requests of interest so you can stay up-to-date on progress.

**Q: How can I submit interest in data if I don’t know a specific source for it?**

A: You can use the general [Contact Us form](https://pages.awscloud.com/adx-contact-dex-contact-us.html) to get in touch with us.

**Q: Do I need to be an AWS customer to submit a request?**

A: No. This project is available to everyone to signal interest for data to be onboarded to AWS Data Exchange.
